Although the literature suggests that donors’ perceptions of effectiveness affect charitable giving, very little is known about what types of projects individuals perceive as more effective. Using data from Kiva.org, this article presents evidence on the relative popularity of competing development projects. We present estimates of the impact of publicly visible project characteristics on funding speed. Assuming that Kiva lenders are motivated by poverty alleviation, the results shed light on individual philanthropists’ perception of project effectiveness. Knowing this can help practitioners design fundraising strategies more effectively, especially for projects that are inherently less popular.},

	abstract = {Smallholder coffee producers face a combination of pre- and post-harvest risk factors that leaves them particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. A popular form of on-farm diversification is honey production through beekeeping, that has both nutritional and commercial value. This study investigates the role of honey production as means of food security management due to the heightened pollinating activity during the coffee flowering stage that follows the annual coffee harvest provides an additional non-contemporaneous source of income. Using primary data collected in coffee-producing regions of Chiapas, Mexico, I find that during the honey harvest months, which occurs during the early stage of the lean season, beekeeping coffee producers are less exposed to food insecurity over coffee producers who don’t diversify into honey.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

	abstract = {We study how aggregate economic conditions affect the timing of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India. In both regions, substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur with marriage: bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents choose when their children marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15\% and aggregate income by 4 to 5\%, have opposite effects on the marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan Africa they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3\%, while in India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4\%. Changes in the age of marriage due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds to short-term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that marriage payments determine the sign of this response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital, it is crucial to understand the economic role of marriage market institutions.},

They consist of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct), and formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights). Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human beings to create order and reduce uncertainty in exchange. Together with the standard constraints of economics they define the choice set and therefore determine transaction and production costs and hence the profitability and feasibility of engaging in economic activity. They evolve incrementally, connecting the past with the present and the future; history in consequence is largely a story of institutional evolution in which the historical performance of economies can only be understood as a part of a sequential story. Institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth, stagnation, or decline.

Studies show that returns from such farms do not generate a living income for producers or workers threatening supplies. Smallholders use agroforestry to reduce coffee production costs, diversify income and address livelihood needs. We undertook a three-phase analysis to test the following hypothesis. Current coffee agroforestry must shift from a low labor, low risk-stable return, slowly-changing matrix to more active management of species and stem turnover in system renovation cycles targeted to sustaining, reorienting and intensifying ecosystem-based benefits to coffee production, diversified income and household food. First, we conducted a document survey of current traditional tree diversity, research trends, and market drivers for more benefits-oriented agroforestry. Second, we proposed a framework for multiple benefits quantification converting tree use characteristics and density into five categories of benefits, each with sub-categories which we tested using previously collected data of stem density by species from coffee agroforestry in northern Nicaragua. Third, we modeled radiation in mixed canopy scenarios using the program {SExI}- {FS} based on modifications of species and density to target food and income diversification and tested our framework by quantifying benefits. We found that smallholder coffee faces farms decreasing coffee margins, labor scarcity, new pests and climate variability best addressed with targeted and adaptive shifts in coffee varieties and associated trees. Increasing data demands from certification and regulations provide a basis more data-driven coffee farm management. Our data bases of stem density by species of established agroforestry systems were sufficient to identify gaps in food and income benefits which were addressed in the scenarios thereby verifying the hypothesis. The benefits ranking both of current systems and three scenarios also provided insights into data collection specifications for a more rigorous academic test of the hypothesis and data-driven grower strategies for agroforestry transformation.},

Commonly at that time malnutrition, morbidity and mortality peak; the costs of sickness—to society in lost agricultural production, and to families in food and income foregone — are at their highest; sickness is most liable to make poor people permanently poorer; and health services are likely to be at their least effective. But systematic biases prevent urban‐based professionals from adequately perceiving this seasonal deprivation; they tend to underestimate morbidity in wet seasons and not to recognise its social and agricultural impacts. More needs to be known about impoverishment through seasonal sickness, about micro‐level seasonal linkages, and about zones of adverse seasonalities; and priority is indicated for research on tropical diseases with seasonal impacts on agriculture. More immediately, seasonal analysis has practical implications for the management of health services, including the supply of medicaments, preventive and curative measures, crdches for working mothers, and the selection of community health workers able to provide care at the times of greatest need. Finally, decentralised seasonal analysis is proposed. This would bring rural health and agricultural staff together to identify local linkages between health, nutrition, agriculture and poverty, and then to plan and implement programmes geared to the seasonal needs of the poorer and more vulnerable people.},

First, we identify salient dimensions of their relational contracts and measure them through an original survey of mills and farmers. Second, we take advantage of an engineering model for the optimal placement of mills to construct an instrument that isolates geographically determined variation in competition. Conditional on the suitability for mills’ placement in the catchment area, we find that mills surrounded by more suitable areas (i) face more competition from other mills, (ii) use fewer relational contracts with farmers, and (iii) exhibit worse performance. An additional competing mill also (iv) reduces the aggregate quantity of coffee supplied to mills by farmers and (v) makes farmers worse off. Competition hampers relational contracts directly by increasing farmers’ temptation to default on the relational contract and indirectly by reducing mills’ profits.},

Second, cooperative members report an increase in the share of coffee sold and income from coffee sales but not in per-kilo price or total income.

	abstract = {Coffee: A Comprehensive Guide to the Bean, the Beverage, and the Industry offers a definitive guide to the many rich dimensions of the bean and the beverage around the world. Leading experts from business and academia consider coffee’s history, global spread, cultivation, preparation, marketing, and the environmental and social issues surrounding it today. They discuss, for example, the impact of globalization; the many definitions of organic, direct trade, and fair trade; the health of female farmers; the relationships among shade, birds, and coffee; roasting as an art and a science; and where profits are made in the commodity chain. Drawing on interviews and the lives of people working in the business—from pickers and roasters to coffee bar owners and consumers—this book brings a compelling human side to the story. The authors avoid romanticizing or demonizing any group in the business. They consider basic but widely misunderstood issues such as who adds value to the bean, the constraints of peasant life, and the impact of climate change. Moving beyond simple answers, they represent various participants in the supply chain and a range of opinions about problems and suggested solutions in the industry. Coffee offers a multidimensional examination of a deceptively everyday but extremely complex commodity that remains at the center of many millions of lives. Tracing coffee’s journey from field to cup, this handbook to one of the world’s favorite beverages is an essential guide for professionals, coffee lovers, and students alike.Contributions by: Sarah Allen, Jonathan D.

Active optical sensors ({AOS}), with their instrumentation directly on agricultural machines, are suitable and make it possible to obtain high-frequency data. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of {AOS} to map the spatial and temporal variability of coffee crop yields, as well as to establish guidelines for the acquisition of {AOS} data for sensing the sides of a coffee plant, allowing the evaluation of large commercial fields. The study was conducted in a commercial coffee area of 10.24 ha, cultivated with the Catuaí 144 variety. Data collection was performed with six Crop Circle {ACS} 430 sensors (Holland Scientific, Lincoln, {NE}, {USA}) and two N-Sensor {NG} sensors (Yara International, Dülmen, Germany). Seven field expeditions were made to collect data using the optical sensors during 2019 and 2021, obtaining data during the flowering, fruit-filling and fruit maturation phases (pre-harvest), and post-harvest. The results showed that the different faces of the same plant present a different Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) to its yield, obtained with a yield monitor on the harvester. The face with the highest exposure to solar radiation presented a slightly higher correlation to yield (−0.34 ≤ r ≤ −0.17) when compared with the face with less exposure (−0.27 ≤ r ≤ −0.15). In addition, it was observed that the vegetation indices measured at the beginning of the coffee cycle (before the rainy season that starts in October) present a positive correlation to the coffee yield of that same year (0.73 ≤ r ≤ 0.91). On the other hand, this relationship is changed after the beginning of the rain season, at which time the vegetation index increases abruptly, inverting the correlation with the yield after that (−0.93 ≤ r ≤ −0.77). Furthermore, it was observed that, due to the biennial nature of coffee production, the vegetation index acquired at a specific time has an inverted relationship when compared with the yield of that year and to the yield of the following (or previous) year.},

	abstract = {Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards—such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance—on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.},

	shorttitle = {Resisting Neoliberal Homogenization},
	abstract = {The Zapatista autonomy movement in Chiapas, Mexico, is a significant example of rising social-movement resistance to neoliberalism. The neoliberal project in Latin America since the 1980s has led to a retrenchment of the state, opening new space for social movements to contest power from below. In Mexico, the weakening of corporatist and clientelist mechanisms once controlled by the party-state allowed groups like the Zapatistas to assert rights based on both collective (ethnic) identity and Mexican national citizenship. An examination of the Zapatista autonomy movement since 1994 suggests several dilemmas: (1) A territorially based model of autonomy as administrative decentralization would not fundamentally alter existing political hierarchies or the role of the state as broker for global capital. (2) Autonomy conceived as mere disengagement would leave autonomous communities cut off from resources and unprotected from the forces of the global market. (3) Autonomy defined as simply cultural pluralism falls into the neoliberal "multiculturalism trap" of atomizing communities, substituting formal "equality" for the power to establish collective identities and demand substantive rights. The Zapatistas have maneuvered around counterinsurgency and co-optation through a flexible, community-based model of autonomy, shifting in 2003 to a model of regional "Juntas de Buen Gobierno" with rotating representatives to integrate the resistance. The experiment holds lessons for other social movements in Latin America struggling to preserve grassroots decision making in opposition to the logic of global capital.},

I offer a simple explanation for this: benefits and costs of technologies are heterogeneous, so that farmers with low net returns do not adopt the technology. I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefficient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net benefits to the technology.},

In particular, it analyses reactions to the 1992 amendment to Article 27 of Mexico’s Constitution, which legalized the rental and sale of previously inalienable ejido land and created programmes and institutions to officially certify ejido members’ land rights. The paper concludes that the complex of economic and legal reforms – combined with the specificities of Sonoran agriculture – has generated a visible change in ejidos with respect to land operation, setting the stage for an accelerated shift towards the privatization of agricultural land in northern Mexico.},

	abstract = {Coffee is an important crop in Mexico. Unfortunately, coffee production has been affected by coffee leaf rust ({CLR}). For Veracruz, the second state in Mexico with the major production of coffee, there are available reports of weekly {CLR} severity, but these are only informative without in-depth inferential analysis. We analyzed variations of {CLR} severity along the year in Veracruz with data from municipal weekly reports provided by Mexico’s federal government phytosanitary epidemiological monitoring coffee program. We selected reports dated in 2018 from nine municipalities and after calculations of mean monthly severity values, we conducted a one-way {ANOVA} (months as factors) of severity data. We compared this information with other coffee-producingregions. Additionally, we explored the association of temperature, rainfall, and altitude with {CLR} severity using Principal Component Analysis and multiple linear regressions. Temperature and rainfall data were obtained from Mexican National Meteorological Service. We found that {CLR} severity in October, November, December, and January (months of harvest period) was significantly higher than values from March-June. During the harvest period, coffee plants allocate resources mainly for fruiting which competes in resources for other tasks such as defense and leaf growth, so this competition of resources can explain the positive relationship found between fruit load and {CLR} severity. This monthly variation of severity was similar to those reported in Chiapas, Guatemala, Colombia, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Our model (R2 = 0.948) showed a significant and negative effect of minimum and maximum temperature (in a range from 9.9 – 15.5 °C and 18.5 – 26.5 °C, respectively) on {CLR} severity, while the effect of rainfall (in a range from 32.0 – 359.9 mm) and mediumtemperature (from 14.3 – 20.5 °C) was positive. With our study, we suggest applications of fungicides in March-June when coffee plantations are in leaf phenophase.

Methods We quantified the development of fungal structures in locally-infected leaf disks from both cultivars, using {qRT}-{PCR} to measure the relative expression of two pathogenesis recognition genes ({CaNDR}1 and {CaNBS}-{LRR}) and three genes associated with the salicylic acid ({SA})-related pathway ({CaNPR}1, {CaPR}1, and {CaPR}5). Results Resistance of the cv. Oro Azteca was significantly higher than that of the cv. Garnica, with 8.2\% and 53.3\% haustorial detection, respectively. In addition, the non-race specific disease resistance gene ({CaNDR}1), a key gene for the pathogen recognition, as well as the genes associated with {SA}, {CaNPR}1, {CaPR}1, and {CaPR}5, presented an increased expression in response to infection by H. vastatrix in cv.

Results: Coffee producers perceive changes in the climate, which affect production. Five physical and three socials measures of adaptation to climate change were recorded. Agroecological producers apply a greater number of adaptive measures than conventional producers, being less vulnerable. Implications: Results allow elaborating recommendations for adaptation to climate change and reducing future vulnerability.

More aggressive outbreaks of the disease were recently reported worldwide, including in Mexico, where coffee production showed a 40\% decrease. This work aimed to determine the environmental conditions that favor release and air transport of the H. vastatrix urediniospores in coffee crops in Veracruz. The monitoring of airborne coffee leaf rust urediniospores was performed using three types of aerobiological traps at different heights: Hirst Spore Trap ({HST}, 1.5 m), Passive Spore Trap ({PST} 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 m), and Sedimentation Spore Sampler ({SSS} 1 m) from January 2014 to October 2015, in two plots in Veracruz, Mexico. The airborne urediniospores counts exhibited a bimodal distribution. Low concentrations that increase over time are evident from January to April, decreasing abruptly in May and June, only to rise again in August, reaching the highest record for airborne urediniospores during the mid-summer drought phenomenon. Dispersal of coffee rust urediniospores is mainly influenced by temperature, rain, wind, and humidity in leaves. They can reach heights in the air up to 9 m (above the canopy) in shade coffee crops. The dispersal of pathogens in the atmosphere comprises complex processes interconnected; their knowledge allows better comprehensive management of them.},

Coffee rust causes a production slump of up to 50\%, significantly affecting the profitability of coffee growers. This work aims to review the integrated rust management in organic coffee crop in different producing countries. Regarding the disease management strategies, this review addresses the use of rust-resistant cultivars, cultural management, biological control, use of plant extracts, and chemical rust control by cupric fungicides. Considering the importance of the organic system, the increase in world coffee consumption, and the potential market for this kind of coffee, this review may help researchers and producers looking for alternative strategies to control rust in an organic coffee cultivation system.},

	abstract = {Few studies worldwide have analysed how to manage equitably the process whereby ‘customary’ or ‘common’ land can be incorporated into future urban development, particularly in so far as this might be achieved through privatization and deregulation. This paper focuses upon Mexico and the 1991–2 reforms of Article 27 which dramatically changed the tenure codes and political relations covering the widespread customary land sector — called ejidos. It is argued that, in effect, the reforms constitute deregulation of former tenure relations rather than outright privatization, and that rather than being radical in content, the reforms are subtle redefinitions of past practices in which the balance of administrative power over ejidal land has shifted significantly, away from the Agrarian Reform Ministry towards the Social Development Ministry and local (city) government. Deregulation appears to offer three principal scenarios for public and private sector ejido land development: Urban Development Companies, Joint Ventures and Extension to the ‘Urban Zone’, yet to date there is little evidence that any one has proven sufficiently attractive to be pursued intensively, and the paper suggests that illegal alienation of ejido land is likely to continue and may get worse. However, the latest Urban Development Program 1995–2000 identifies ejido land deregulation and urban development as one of its principal strategies, tied to President Zedillo’s New Federalism project, which seeks to strengthen municipal and state government capacity and effectiveness. This profound shift in the structure of political managerial authority and responsibility offers the increased likelihood that land regularization practices and urban planning of the now deregulated ejidos will become more significant in the future.},

In 1996 governmental officials arrived in Tecoripa, a small livestock ejido village in Sonora, to assist ejidatarios (ejido members) in deciding whether to privatize. The ejidatarios struggled with two problems simultaneously: whether to privatize and whether to increase the size of their individual parcels from ten to twentyseven hectares, thereby decreasing the amount of communally owned lands. A key motive force in the ejido's decision has been the ejidatarios' desire to increase individual cattle production. This would be accomplished by clearing the native forest and creating an artificial grassland by planting buffelgrass, an African exotic. Ejidatarios believe that by privatizing, expanding their individual holdings, and creating grassland, they will become more prosperous. In Tecoripa they have sought the twin goals of privatizing and expanding their parcels. Their confidence in gaining increased wealth through expanded cattle production is based on inadequate information, however. Ecological variables and economic forces pose grave threats to the long-term viability of their private initiative.},

The phenolic compounds and flavonoids identified as chemical markers of interest were coumaric, caffeic, and cinnamic acid, as well as luteolin, quercetin, and isorhamnetin. Tukey's multiple comparison tests showed no major significant differences between the composition of the honey samples from organic coffee growing areas compared to conventional plantations, mainly because of the similarity of floral sources in the surrounding area. Additionally, an analysis of pesticides and heavy metals showed the absence of such components in all samples, confirming that regardless of the type of production, this region is an environmentally clean agricultural zone. This information will generate bases for the differentiation by origin of honey from Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, aimed to improve their marketing and promote added value.},

Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable. In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a {GLM} analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30\%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others.},

We examined the relative importance of insect, wind, and spontaneous self-pollination and the degree of self-fertility of these two coffee species in 24 agroforestry coffee fields in Indonesia. In both species, open pollination and cross pollination by hand led to the highest fruit set. Wind pollination (including self-pollination) led to 16\% lower fruit set than open pollination in C. canephora and to 12.3\% lower fruit set in C. arabica. Self-pollinated flowers and unmanipulated controls achieved an extremely low fruit set of 10\% or less in the self-sterile species, and of 60\% and 48\%, respectively in the self-fertile species. These results constitute experimental evidence that cross pollination by bees causes a significant increase in fruit set of not only the self-sterile, but also the self-fertile coffee species. The practical implication is that coffee yield may be improved by managing fields for increased flower visitation by bees.},

No community will totally give up economic activities for the sake of ecological integrity, unless it is given alternative economic activities from which to draw its livelihood. Beekeeping in the forest buffer zone instead of traditional destructive honey-harvesting from forest trees is one such option at Arabuko Sokoke Forest ({ASF}) in Kenya. {ASF} is a dry coastal forest which is home to endangered and threatened fauna and is a hotspot considered a priority for conservation. In order to find out whether honey quantity and quality differed with distance from the forest, we studied honey yield per harvest (kg) and obtained samples from hives placed at varying distances from {ASF} in two successive years. Honey yield increased with proximity to the forest. Indeed the yield almost doubled in hives placed less than 1km from the forest compared to those placed more than 3km from the forest. All the honey samples met internationally required quality standards, although sugar levels were at the lower limit. This study demonstrates that the conservation of tropical forest ecosystems can have real local economic benefits. The documentation of the services provided by nearby natural areas should help make conservation of these areas a priority, even for the local communities.},

Sixty bee flora species belonging to trees (30), shrubs (21) and woody lianas (9) were identified and compared across plots. Results show that more bee flora diversity in {FC} (2.03) than {SFC} (1.09) system. Honey yield data was collected from 78 ({FC} = 52, {SFC} = 26) beekeepers. The honey yield of {FC} was higher than {SFC} system in both high and low production years. The honey production on average was 9.58 kg hive-1 for {FC} and 6.44 kg hive-1 for {SFC} in high production year while 6.5 kg hive-1 for {FC} and 4.24 kg hive-1 for {SFC} in low production year. To assess the honey quality, 6 kg honey samples ({FC} = 3, {SFC} = 3) were collected. Six honey quality parameters i.e. moisture, ash, {pH}, free acidity, electrical conductivity ({EC}) and total soluble solid ({TSS}) contents. The biochemical variation in the composition is significantly different (P{\textless}0.05) in ash content, {pH}, {EC} and free acidity when comparing {FC} with {SFC} honey samples while the percentage of moisture and {TSS} contents were insignificant (p{\textgreater}0.05). The study revealed that coffee management is associated with a decline in bee flora diversity, honey yields and on top of this, it has implications on honey quality deteriorations. Thus, there is an urgent need for control and monitoring on the expansion of {SFC} cultivation, which needs immediate conservation measures. Therefore, conservationists have to take actions for biodiversity conservation specially bee flora species diversity and ecosystem services that accompanied with coffee management and {FC} intensifications.},

	abstract = {Can economic forces be harnessed for biodiversity conservation? The answer hinges on characterizing the value of nature, a tricky business from biophysical, socioeconomic, and ethical perspectives. Although the societal benefits of native ecosystems are clearly immense, they remain largely unquantified for all but a few services. Here, we estimate the value of tropical forest in supplying pollination services to agriculture. We focus on coffee because it is one of the world's most valuable export commodities and is grown in many of the world's most biodiverse regions. Using pollination experiments along replicated distance gradients, we found that forest-based pollinators increased coffee yields by 20\% within ≈1 km of forest. Pollination also improved coffee quality near forest by reducing the frequency of “peaberries” (i.e., small misshapen seeds) by 27\%. During 2000–2003, pollination services from two forest fragments (46 and 111 hectares) translated into ≈\$60,000 (U.S.) per year for one Costa Rican farm. This value is commensurate with expected revenues from competing land uses and far exceeds current conservation incentive payments. Conservation investments in human-dominated landscapes can therefore yield double benefits: for biodiversity and agriculture.},

We use covariate-matching specifications associated with spatially explicit variables and difference-in-difference estimators to determine the treatment effect.

Despite this high degree of additionality, we also observe lack of compliance in some plots participating in the {PES} program.

The prototypes compared were: traditional maize (rotational prototype with pioneer native trees evaluated in the crop period), Taungya (maize with timber trees), improved fallow, traditional fallow (the last three rotational prototypes in the crop-free period), Inga-shade-organic coffee, polyculture-shade organic coffee, polyculture-non-organic coffee, pasture without trees, pasture with live fences, and pasture with scattered trees. Taungya and improved fallow were designed agroforestry prototypes, while the others were reproduced traditional systems. Seventy-nine plots were selected in three agro-climatic zones. Carbon in living biomass, dead biomass, and soil organic matter was measured in each plot. Results showed that carbon in living biomass and dead organic matter were different according to prototype; while soil organic carbon and total carbon were influenced mostly by the agro-climatic zone (P {\textless} 0.01). Carbon density in the high tropical agro-climatic zone (1,000 m) was higher compared to the intermediate and low tropical agro-climatic zones (600 and 200 m, respectively, P {\textless} 0.01). All the systems contained more carbon than traditional maize and pastures without trees. Silvopastoral systems, improved fallow, Taungya and coffee systems (especially polyculture-shade coffee and organic coffee) have the potential to sequester carbon via growing trees. Agroforestry systems could also contribute to carbon sequestration and reducing emissions when burning is avoided. The potential of organic coffee to maintain carbon in soil and to reduce emissions from deforestation and ecosystem degradation ({REDD}) is discussed.},

Results showed that shade cover percentage and coffee shrub density had significant effects on yields. Maintaining coffee shrub density as a constant, a regression equation related yield to percentage shade by a quadratic polynomial. Coffee density had a significant effect on yields but shade tree density had no effect. Coffee cultivar, age of coffee stand, species richness, shade tree density, basal area, slope and aspect did not have significant effects on coffee yields. Shade tree cover had a positive effect between 23 and 38\% shade cover and yield was then maintained up to 48\%. Production may decrease under shade cover {\textgreater}50\%.

In this region coffee is grown under either the canopy of natural forest or under a planted canopy dominated by Inga spp. Despite the large differences in diversity of dominant plant species, both planted and rustic shade coffee plantations support a high overall diversity of bird species; we recorded approximately 105 species in each plantation type on fixed radius point counts. We accumulated a combined species list of 180 species on repeatedly surveyed transects through both coffee plantation types. These values are exceeded regionally only by moist tropical forest. Of the habitats surveyed, shade coffee was second only to acacia groves in the abundance and diversity of Nearctic migrants. The two plantation types have similar bird species lists and both are similar in composition to the dominant woodland—mixed pine-oak. Both types of shade coffee plantation habitats differ from other local habitats in supporting highly seasonal bird populations. Survey numbers almost double during the dry season—an increase that is found in omnivorous migrants and omnivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous resident species. Particularly large influxes were found for Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina) and northern orioles (Icterus galbula) in Inga dominated plantations.},

A history of over 7000 years of agriculture, and a persistent tradition of peasant social resistance movements that climaxed during the agrarian revolution in the early 20th century, continued in the indigenous resistance in Chiapas leading to the Zapatista uprising in 1992, and continues to be expressed in present local and regional confrontations for the defense of territory. Scholars agree that agroecology conceptually includes ecological and agricultural scientific research activity, empirical practices applied for agriculture, and the nuclear goal of numerous rural social movements. What has not been sufficiently established is how these three spheres of agroecology interact with each other and what emergent synergies they generate. Taking as an example the production in Mexico of three key agricultural goods—maize, coffee, and honey—our paper briefly reviews the existing relations between knowledge generation, agroecological practices, and rural social processes. We conclude by reflecting on the role of agroecological research in the context of an agrarian sustainability committed to helping reduce social inequity, marginality, and exploitation, as much as reverting the severe deterioration of the natural environment: both common issues in contemporary Mexico.},

	abstract = {Tropical montane forests have been recognised as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Our study focuses on the rate of loss and patterns of fragmentation in tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, during a 25-year period. Data from Landsat satellite imagery from 1975 ({MSS}), 1990 ({TM}) and 2000 ({ETM}+) were used to ascertain annual deforestation rates of 1.3 and 4.8\% for the 1975–1990 and 1990–2000 periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of forest fragmentation were identified using selected landscape indices. Increases in the number of forest fragments (3520–10,542), patch density (1.0–3.2patches/100ha), and total edge length (24,781–38,400km) were associated with decreases in the mean patch size (65.0–8.7ha), largest patch index (60.7–4.0\%), total core area (99,422–9,611ha), and mean proximity index (101,369–1405). The observed trends indicate increasing deforestation and fragmentation, particularly during the 1990–2000 period. Circa 50\% of the forest cover in the Highlands has been lost in 25 years, and a proportion of the remaining forests have been degraded as a result of human use. Increasing human population and a more demanding use of soils for agriculture and timber arise as the major causes of deforestation in the study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should be focused on the management of the natural system and the management of the external influences on it, particularly the detection of hotspots, passive and active restoration and sustainable forest exploitation by the local indigenous communities.},

	abstract = {Coffee agroforestry systems are a promising approach to the challenge of sustaining both biodiversity and livelihoods in tropical landscapes. However, coffee farmers' response to the unrelenting coffee leaf rust ({CLR}) outbreak may have repercussions for the potential of coffee agroforestry systems to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Adaptations in management practices could affect the extent to which farmers rely on ecological processes vs. external inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) to support production. This study investigates farmers' response to {CLR} outbreak through a study in a forest frontier in a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted household surveys and fieldwork before the {CLR} outbreak in 2011-2012 (n = 59), and follow-up surveys after the outbreak in 2016 (n = 48). Before {CLR} outbreak, farmers were cultivating Arabica coffee varieties in agroforestry systems and generally following agroecological approaches. Most farmers (82\%) were certified organic and did not employ synthetic agrochemicals. Farmers (66\%) had plans to expand their Arabica coffee agroforests either into forest (35\%) or fallow (31\%) in response to high farm gate prices. After {CLR} outbreak, 94\% of farmers had {CLR}-resistant hybrid coffee varieties ({HCV}) in their possession and were either incorporating them by substituting affected Arabica coffee plants in existing fields, or by establishing new coffee fields with {HCV} at lower elevations. In attempts to control {CLR}, farmers (54\%) also applied agrochemicals at least once and, to a lesser extent (19\%), removed shade trees. Among the farmers (63\%) who were planning on expanding coffee production with {HCV}, more farmers were planning on expanding on fallow (46\%) than forest (17\%) compared to the period before {CLR} outbreak (p-value {\textless} 0.05). Public and private actors promoted and distributed saplings of {HCV} and agrochemicals along with technical assistance. The promotion of {HCV} along with fertilizers may result in a substitution of ecosystem functions with agrochemicals, and the need to acquire seeds and saplings outside of farmers’ own resource base and networks. This shift in management strategies generates new instabilities and risks by introducing a new market for {HCV} about which little is known and by making external agents the holders of productive resources and knowledge.},

Most plantations are cultivated with susceptible cultivars, such as those of the Catuaí and Mundo Novo groups. Brazilian research institutes have developed dozens of cultivars with different levels of resistance, and significantly increased the planting of new resistant cultivars. The main sources of {CLR} resistance are genotypes from Híbrido de Timor, Icatu, {BA} series carrying the {SH}3 gene, and Ethiopian wild coffees. High {CLR} resistance is still observed in Sarchimor and {SH}3-carrying genotypes. Intermediate {CLR} resistance is observed in Ethiopian wild coffees and in Sarchimor and Icatu derivatives, where qualitative resistance has been supplanted by races of Hemileia vastatrix. Contact, mesostemic, and systemic fungicides are used for chemical control in Brazil. {CLR} incidence in Brazil begins to increase after the rainy season onset in November, reaches a peak in June, and remains high until August. Thus, chemical control is typically applied from December to April.},

Hotspot regions, mainly in Asia, even face simultaneous transgression of multiple underlying local boundaries. If these boundaries were strictly respected, the present food system could provide a balanced diet (2,355 kcal per capita per day) for 3.4 billion people only. However, as we also demonstrate, transformation towards more sustainable production and consumption patterns could support 10.2 billion people within the planetary boundaries analysed.

Although overall cultivated coffee area has decreased by 8\% since 1990, coffee production and agricultural intensification have increased in many places and shifted globally, with production expanding in Asia while contracting in Africa. Ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, climate regulation, and nutrient sequestration are generally greater in shaded coffee farms, but many coffee-growing regions are removing shade trees from their management.

	abstract = {The negative effects of climate change are already evident for many of the 25 million coffee farmers across the tropics and the 90 billion dollar ({US}) coffee industry. The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), the most important pest of coffee worldwide, has already benefited from the temperature rise in East Africa: increased damage to coffee crops and expansion in its distribution range have been reported. In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here, maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the {CLIMEX} model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for {HADCM}3 model). In both scenarios, the situation with H. hampei is forecasted to worsen in the current Coffea arabica producing areas of Ethiopia, the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt. Elgon regions, Mt. Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon, and most of Rwanda and Burundi. The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica-producing areas from five to ten. These outcomes will have serious implications for C. arabica production and livelihoods in East Africa. We suggest that the best way to adapt to a rise of temperatures in coffee plantations could be via the introduction of shade trees in sun grown plantations. The aims of this study are to fill knowledge gaps existing in the coffee industry, and to draft an outline for the development of an adaptation strategy package for climate change on coffee production.

	abstract = {Shade-grown coffee, which is grown under a forest-like canopy of trees, is a production system widely regarded as environmentally sustainable and enabling for biodiversity conservation. Although shade-coffee systems enhance pest-control services from birds, there is an important potential tradeoff, namely lower coffee yields. Yet few studies have explicitly examined this tradeoff and the economic incentives required for smallholders to adopt shade practices rather than conventional systems, in which coffee is grown in full sun or little shade. We formulated a dynamic optimization problem to model a grower's decision to convert land from conventional to shade-grown production based on (1) expected yields and costs of each system, (2) gains from pest-control services provided by birds and (3) price premiums for higher-quality, sustainably-grown coffee. Our results suggest that at least 36\% of a five-hectare farm should be allocated to shade-grown coffee to maximize inter-temporal income. This proportion is positively related to (1) production savings associated with birds, (2) prices for shade-grown and conventional coffees, (3) number of trees used for shade and (4) yields of shade-grown coffee. We show that smallholders have incentives to allocate more land to shade-grown coffee when they benefit from bird conservation under the appropriate market conditions.},

Moreover, Ethiopia is a country where apicultural research is being conducted in a coordinated manner under the national agricultural research system. Hence, a lot of information have been gathered o different aspects of the beekeeping. This is a review of various research results that are from published and unpublished papers over a long period of time in the course of the apicultural research. It has been revealed that the country’s beekeeping subsector is mainly practiced using traditional basket hives with low productivity. However, attempts by various investigators and development actors showed that both the production and quality can be improved in terms of transforming the beekeeping system, processing and marketing. This review paper also tried to address both the domestic and international honey marketing and identified some of the major challenges that are obstacles to the possible maximization of benefits by producers and the whole national economy.},

Honey bees provide pollination services that are crucial for sexual reproduction and improving the quality and quantity of many agricultural crops. From the significant 53 crops cultivated in Ethiopia, 33 (62.2\%) of them are dependent on biological pollinators. Besides this, honey bees play a vital economic role, and their contribution to pollination service in agriculture crops is around 0.815 billion dollars in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, this contribution is unnoticed by Ethiopian farmers. Pollination by honey bee plays an essential role in human nutrition and supplies food security, income in households, and ecosystem services. Declines in insect pollinators, including honey bees across the world, have raised concerns about the supply of pollination services to agriculture, and it is because one-third of agriculture productions depend upon pollination, mainly by honey bees. Among the several factors responsible for the decline of honey bee colonies, improper pesticide application, and climate change are the elements and make them at risk. The potential adverse effects of pollinator declines include direct economic losses incurred by reduced crop yields as well as broader impacts on the agricultural activity because of lower productivity in the ecosystems. Through promoting and the use of honey bee pollination service as agricultural development packages, it is possible to improve honey bee production and crop yield in Ethiopia.},

Besides confirming the importance of the availability resources and some well known adaptive responses, such as workload intensification, expenses reduction or the importance of social networks, the classification of households reveals a sequence in the implementation of flexibility mechanisms. The focus on the combination of coffee and honey productions also suggests changing the traditional approaches to agricultural processes toward the adoption of a more systemic perspective.

	abstract = {In the last century, a global transformation of Earth’s surface has occurred due to human activity with extensive agriculture replacing natural ecosystems. Concomitant declines in wild and managed bees are occurring, largely due to a lack of floral resources and inadequate nutrition, caused by conversion to monoculture-based farming. Diversified fruit and vegetable farms may provide an enhanced variety of resources through crops and weedy plants, which have potential to sustain human and bee nutrition. We hypothesized fruit and vegetable farms can enhance honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Apis mellifera Linnaeus) colony growth and nutritional state over a soybean monoculture, as well as support a more diverse wild bee community. We tracked honey bee colony growth, nutritional state, and wild bee abundance, richness, and diversity in both farm types. Honey bees kept at diversified farms had increased colony weight and preoverwintering nutritional state. Regardless of colony location, precipitous declines in colony weight occurred during autumn and thus colonies were not completely buffered from the stressors of living in a matrix dominated with monocultures. Contrary to our hypothesis, wild bee diversity was greater in soybean, specifically in August, a time when fields are in bloom. These differences were largely driven by four common bee species that performed well in soybean. Overall, these results suggest fruit and vegetable farms provide some benefits for honey bees; however, they do not benefit wild bee communities. Thus, incorporation of natural habitat, rather than diversified farming, in these landscapes, may be a better choice for wild bee conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Studies have documented biodiversity losses due to intensification of coffee management (reduction in canopy richness and complexity). Nevertheless, questions remain regarding relative sensitivity of different taxa, habitat specialists, and functional groups, and whether implications for biodiversity conservation vary across regions. We quantitatively reviewed data from ant, bird, and tree biodiversity studies in coffee agroecosystems to address the following questions: Does species richness decline with intensification or with individual vegetation characteristics? Are there significant losses of species richness in coffee-management systems compared with forests? Is species loss greater for forest species or for particular functional groups? and Are ants or birds more strongly affected by intensification? Across studies, ant and bird richness declined with management intensification and with changes in vegetation. Species richness of all ants and birds and of forest ant and bird species was lower in most coffee agroecosystems than in forests, but rustic coffee (grown under native forest canopies) had equal or greater ant and bird richness than nearby forests. Sun coffee (grown without canopy trees) sustained the highest species losses, and species loss of forest ant, bird, and tree species increased with management intensity. Losses of ant and bird species were similar, although losses of forest ants were more drastic in rustic coffee. Richness of migratory birds and of birds that forage across vegetation strata was less affected by intensification than richness of resident, canopy, and understory bird species. Rustic farms protected more species than other coffee systems, and loss of species depended greatly on habitat specialization and functional traits. We recommend that forest be protected, rustic coffee be promoted, and intensive coffee farms be restored by augmenting native tree density and richness and allowing growth of epiphytes. We also recommend that future research focus on potential trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and farmer livelihoods stemming from coffee production.},

The world has been facing a paradox of widespread food insecurity and malnutrition amid net food surpluses. Increased food supplies do not automatically enhance access to food by the poorer groups of society. Food security measures alone may have a limited effect on the nutritional well being of individuals, unless the reinforcing detrimental linkages between food insecurity, disease, poor sanitation and inadequate education are addressed. Current theory holds that good nutrition for pre‐schoolers depends on household food security, an adequate health environment, and adequate maternal and childcare. Pakistan is a low‐income developing country with a per capita income of {US}\$443, one of the lowest in the world. Pakistan is not a food insecure country. It generally has the economic ability to import the required food. This paper considers the main features of determinants of food security in Pakistan, particularly household economy assessment, and looks at what conclusions can realistically be drawn out of analysis when conducted within a conceptual framework.},

Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular we demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects, and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and their choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. We also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.},

The model is initially fitted with 16 (for general) and 19 (for farmer households) variables, selected from factors identified by previous researchers that affect food insecurity. Twelve out of 19 variables for farmer households are found to be significant such as household size, household size square, household income, number of rooms, dependency ratio, electricity connection, irrigation facility, age and age square of household head. To our surprise female education variable is insignificant for general household model. The results obtained are further analyzed to compute partial effects on continuous variables and change in the probabilities on discrete variables for the significant factors in the logistic models. Household size, education of household head, annual income and agricultural income are some of the most important factors influencing the household’s food insecurity status.},

            We play a series of incentivised laboratory games with risk-exposed co-operativised Guatemalan coffee farmers to understand the demand for index-based rainfall insurance. We estimate an explicit utility curve for every player and hence predict expected utility demand under counterfactual scenarios. Using these estimates, we provide a precise money-metric decomposition of the extent to which the low observed demand for index insurance is driven by expected utility theory, or by behavioural issues arising from a prospect-style utility structure. Our results suggest that consumers value probabilistic insurance using a prospect-style utility function that is concave both in probabilities and in income.},

Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer’s own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer’s social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.},

They found that considering a projected financial decision, such as how to pay for a car repair, affects people's performance on unrelated spatial and reasoning tasks. Lower-income individuals performed poorly if the repairs were expensive but did fine if the cost was low, whereas higher-income individuals performed well in both conditions, as if the projected financial burden imposed no cognitive pressure. Similarly, the sugarcane farmers from Tamil Nadu performed these tasks better after harvest than before.

            The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.},

We do so in labs with {US} college students as well as in the ﬁeld with Peruvian farmers. First, as regards price risk at the extensive margin, we ﬁnd no support for Sandmo’s prediction. Second, consistent with Batra and Ullah’s prediction, we ﬁnd that output decreases in response to price risk at the intensive margin when imposing a linear relationship between output and price risk. When relaxing the assumption of linearity between output and price risk, however, we ﬁnd a nonmonotonic relationship between output and price risk. Taken together, these results are broadly inconsistent with expected utility theory. Alternative models of behavior in the face of risk, such as prospect theory, may explain the behavior we observe.},

Risk is at the center of new paradigms and approaches that inform risk management initiatives and shape investments in many countries. Although the literature includes several substantive reviews of the methods available for risk analysis and their empirical applications have been extensively scrutinized, limited information exists about which types of risks have received sufficient attention, and which have not. This limited information is perplexing because farmers manage multiple risks at the same time and unanticipated events continue to have substantial impacts on farmers. We identify 3283 peer-reviewed studies that address one or more of the five major types of risk in agriculture (production risk, market risk, institutional risk, personal risk, and financial risk) published between 1974 and 2019. We conduct a literature search and then apply an eligibility criteria to retain eligible studies from the search. We then classify those eligible studies based on risk type and geographic focus. We placed no limit on the temporal scale, geographic focus, or study method for inclusion in our search. Results show that 66\% of the 3283 studies focused solely on production risk, with only 15\% considering more than one type of risk. Only 18 studies considered all five types of risk and those either asked how farmers perceived the importance of each risk or were focused on conceptual issues, rather than assessing how exposure to all the risks quantitatively affects farm indicators such as yields or incomes. Without more detailed analyses of the multiple types of risks faced by farmers, farmers and policymakers will lack the information needed to devise relevant risk management strategies and policies. A shift in research focus towards the analysis of multiple contemporaneous types of risk may provide a basis that gives farmers greater options for coping with and managing risk. We discuss some of the challenges for studying multiple risks simultaneously, including data requirements and the need for probability distributions and the role of simulation approaches.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of saving behavior. When consumers are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively, and at a greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes. As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained by traditional life-cycle models.},

More than 1 billion people are estimated to lack sufficient dietary energy availability, and at least twice that number suffer micronutrient deficiencies. Because indicators inform action, much current research focuses on improving food insecurity measurement. Yet estimated prevalence rates and patterns remain tenuous because measuring food security, an elusive concept, remains difficult.},

	abstract = {Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coﬀee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational aﬃliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate signiﬁcantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with oﬀ-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coﬀee reported fewer lean months. We ﬁnd evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households aﬃliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those aﬃliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coﬀee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Income diversification is promoted as one of the key strategies to address food insecurity. While its impact on food security is extensively examined, knowledge of this relationship in a resource poor context experiencing environmental variability and climate change is sparse. We examined income diversification and household food insecurity in a deprived context in Ghana—the Upper West Region. Employing multivariate ordered logistic regression, we analyzed cross-sectional survey data collected on household heads (n = 1438) to explain the association between income diversification and household food insecurity. We found that household heads who reported being highly income diversified were more likely to report being severely food insecure ({OR} = 1.09, p ≤ 0.001). Also, poorer households compared to the richest, and those headed by widows compared to those headed by married people were more likely to report being severely food insecure. Although income diversification is a necessary strategy for survival in the Upper West Region, this alone does not seem to alleviate food insecurity in some families. Given that the region experiences high deprivation and negative effects of environmental variability, we recommend expansion of the non-farm sector to create job opportunities, while implementing a comprehensive national food security policy to address tithing problems of food production and distribution in the Upper West Region, and in similar context.},

Specifically, we show that a new rice variety that reduces downside risk by providing flood tolerance has positive effects on adoption of a more labor-intensive planting method, area cultivated, fertilizer usage, and credit utilization. We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments. Therefore, improved technologies that reduce risk by protecting production in bad years have the potential to increase agricultural productivity in normal years. ({JEL} O13, O33, Q14, Q15, Q16)},

The relationship of these input adjustments to experience further indicates the presence of social learning. In addition, applying the same method to input choices for another crop, of known technology, correctly indicates an absence of social learning effects. ({JEL} D83, O13, O33, Q16)},

We argue that this heterogeneity makes the adoption process more challenging, limits the scope of many innovations, and contributes to the stagnation in technology use.
